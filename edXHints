edX guidance from Machine Learning course:

The caret package requires that we add column names to the feature matrices.
In general, it is a good idea to test out a small subset of the data first to get an idea of how long your code will take to run.

Ensembles combine multiple machine learning algorithms into one model to improve predictions.

Recommendation systems are more complicated machine learning challenges because each outcome has a different set of predictors. For example, different users rate a different number of movies and rate different movies.
To compare different models or to see how well weâ€™re doing compared to a baseline, we will use root mean squared error (RMSE) as our loss function. We can interpret RMSE similar to standard deviation.
If  is the number of user-movie combinations,  is the rating for movie  by user , and  is our prediction, then RMSE is defined as follows:
